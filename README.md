Scripts for GRL paper Bellucci et al. 2022 (Intermittent behaviour in AMOC-AMV relationship)  

This script is a diagnostic tool used to perform the analyses presented in Bellucci et al.(2022; hereafter B22).
Specifically, the scripts implements a change point detection algorithm to identify changes in the statistical
properties of an AMOC-AMV moving correlation data sequence. The algorithm is based on the Pruned Exact Linear Time
(PELT) scheme (Killick et al., 2012) and requires the ruptures Python library, a package designed for the analysis
and segmentation of non-stationary signals (Truong et al., 2020). 
Additionally, this script does also implement continuous wavelet transform analysis (Terrence and Compo (1998) and 
other statistical analyses as presented in B22.
